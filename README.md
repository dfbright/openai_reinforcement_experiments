After doing a few Andrew Ng courses on coursera, I decided to give reinforcement learning a try.  Both agents solve the same problem in basically the same way, but one uses straight python \ numpy and the other does it in tensorflow.  Doing it without tensorflow always gives me a much better idea of what's actually going on.
